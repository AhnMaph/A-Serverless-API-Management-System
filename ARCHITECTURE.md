# System Architecture

## Overview
This document describes the architecture of our Serverless API Management System, which provides a robust, scalable, and secure way to manage APIs using Kong Gateway, with comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting capabilities.

## System Components

### 1. API Gateway Layer
- **Kong Gateway (v3.8)**
  - Primary API gateway and management interface
  - Handles routing, authentication, and rate limiting
  - Exposes multiple ports:
    - 8000: Proxy port for API requests
    - 8001: Admin API
    - 8002: Kong Manager UI
    - 8443: SSL Proxy
    - 8444: SSL Admin API
  - Integrated plugins:
    - File logging
    - Prometheus metrics
    - SSL/TLS support

### 2. Backend Services
- **Multiple Backend Instances**
  - Three identical backend services (backend-1, backend-2, backend-3)
  - Built from Django application
  - Load balanced through Kong Gateway
  - Each instance runs in its own container

### 3. Data Layer
- **PostgreSQL (v13)**
  - Stores Kong configurations
  - Persistent data storage
  - Health checks implemented
  - Secure password management using Docker secrets

### 4. Monitoring Stack
- **Prometheus**
  - Metrics collection from Kong and logging service
  - 15-second scrape interval
  - Persistent storage for metrics data
  - Custom alert rules for:
    - High error rates (5xx responses)
    - Logging service issues

- **Grafana**
  - Visualization of metrics
  - Custom dashboards
  - Admin interface on port 3000

### 5. Logging Stack (ELK)
- **Elasticsearch**
  - Centralized log storage
  - Single-node configuration
  - 512MB memory allocation
  - Health monitoring

- **Logstash**
  - Log processing and transformation
  - Custom pipeline configuration
  - Input from Kong logs

- **Kibana**
  - Log visualization and analysis
  - Web interface on port 5601
  - Connected to Elasticsearch

### 6. Custom Logging Service
- Dedicated service for log management
- Exposes ports:
  - 8081: Main service port
  - 8003: Admin interface
- Handles:
  - Kong gateway logs
  - Service-specific logs
  - Log aggregation and processing

## Network Architecture

### Docker Network
- Single bridge network (`kong-net`)
- All services connected to this network
- Internal DNS resolution enabled
- Isolated from host network

### Port Exposures
```
Service          Port    Description
Kong Gateway     8000    API Proxy
Kong Admin       8001    Admin API
Kong Manager     8002    Web UI
Kong SSL         8443    SSL Proxy
Kong Admin SSL   8444    SSL Admin
Logging Service  8081    Main Service
Logging Admin    8003    Admin Interface
Prometheus       9090    Metrics
Grafana          3000    Dashboards
Elasticsearch    9200    Search API
Kibana           5601    Web Interface
```

## Security Features

### SSL/TLS
- SSL certificates for Kong Gateway
- Secure admin interfaces
- Encrypted communication

### Authentication
- Kong Gateway authentication
- Grafana admin authentication
- Secure password management

### Network Security
- Internal Docker network
- Controlled port exposure
- Service isolation

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Metrics Collection
- Kong performance metrics
- Service health metrics
- System resource usage

### Alert Rules
1. High Error Rate Alert
   - Triggers on 5xx error rate > 10%
   - 5-minute evaluation window
   - Critical severity

2. Logging Service Alert
   - Triggers on high error rate
   - 5-minute evaluation window
   - Warning severity

## Data Persistence

### Volumes
- PostgreSQL data
- Prometheus metrics
- Grafana dashboards
- Elasticsearch indices
- Kong logs
- Service logs

## Deployment Architecture

### Container Orchestration
- Docker Compose for service orchestration
- Health checks for critical services
- Automatic restart policies
- Service dependencies management

### Scaling
- Multiple backend instances
- Load balancing through Kong
- Stateless service design
- Horizontal scaling capability

## Development and Operations

### Development Tools
- Docker for containerization
- Makefile for common operations
- Environment variable management
- Configuration management

### Operations Tools
- Logging and monitoring
- Alert management
- Health checks
- Backup and restore capabilities
